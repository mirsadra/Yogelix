"Generate a personalized yoga exercise plan based on the following user data: Body Mass ( \bodyMass \bodyMass), Average Daily Heart Rate ( \heartRateAverageOfDay \heartRateAverageOfDay), Height ( \height \height), Average Daily Walking/Running Distance ( \walkingRunningDistanceAverageOfDay \walkingRunningDistanceAverageOfDay), Average Daily Active Energy Burned ( \activeEnergyBurnedAverageOfDay \activeEnergyBurnedAverageOfDay), Sleep Analysis ( \sleepAnalysis \sleepAnalysis), and Mindful Sessions ( \mindfulSession \mindfulSession). The plan should include a Warmup, several [Work - Recovery] sequences, and a Cooldown, with the entire session lasting between 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust the intensity and complexity of the exercises according to the user's fitness data, ensuring a balance between physical fitness and mental well-being.

ChatGPT, please create a personalized yoga exercise plan tailored to an individual's specific health data. Use the following metrics: body mass ((bodyMass)), average daily heart rate ((heartRateAverageOfDay)), height ((height)), average daily walking/running distance ((walkingRunningDistanceAverageOfDay)), average daily active energy burned ((activeEnergyBurnedAverageOfDay)), sleep quality ((sleepAnalysis)), and mindfulness session insights ((mindfulSession)). The session should include a Warmup, multiple [Work - Recovery] phases with gradually increasing intensity based on the fitness data, and a Cooldown phase. Ensure the entire session lasts between 30 to 45 minutes, balancing physical exertion with mental relaxation and mindfulness. Adapt the intensity of the yoga poses and sequences to align with the individual's daily activity level and heart rate data, and incorporate elements that foster mental well-being, reflecting insights from sleep and mindful sessions.

ChatGPT, I request a customized yoga exercise plan crafted specifically using these health metrics: body mass ((bodyMass)), daily average heart rate ((heartRateAverageOfDay)), height ((height)), average daily distance from walking and running ((walkingRunningDistanceAverageOfDay)), daily average active energy expenditure ((activeEnergyBurnedAverageOfDay)), sleep quality analysis ((sleepAnalysis)), and insights from mindfulness sessions ((mindfulSession)). The session should be structured as follows:

Warmup (5-10 minutes): Gentle stretches and breathing exercises, considering the individual's flexibility and heart rate data.
[Work - Recovery] Phases (20-30 minutes): Sequence of yoga poses, alternating between more active (Work) and restorative (Recovery) poses. Intensity and complexity of poses should be scaled according to the individual's daily activity levels and energy expenditure.
Cooldown (5-10 minutes): Gradual transition to slower, relaxing poses and meditation, with emphasis on mindfulness and relaxation, reflecting the insights from sleep and mindful sessions.
The entire session should be within 30-45 minutes, offering a balanced approach to physical activity and mental wellness. The plan should dynamically adjust poses and intensity based on the user's physical metrics while integrating mindfulness practices for mental health benefits.
```

```
SYSTEM: Utilize the provided user data to create a personalized yoga exercise plan. The plan should be structured with a Warmup, alternating Work-Recovery segments, and a Cooldown, lasting between 30 to 45 minutes in total. Pay close attention to the user's physical metrics to tailor the exercises accordingly.

USER DATA:

Body Mass: \(bodyMass)
Average Daily Heart Rate: \(heartRateAverageOfDay)
Height: \(height)
Average Daily Walking/Running Distance: \(walkingRunningDistanceAverageOfDay)
Average Daily Active Energy Burned: \(activeEnergyBurnedAverageOfDay)
Sleep Analysis: \(sleepAnalysis)
Mindful Session Duration: \(mindfulSession)
INSTRUCTIONS:

Warmup (5-10 minutes): Suggest gentle stretches or yoga poses that prepare the body for exercise, considering the user's sleep quality and energy levels.
Work-Recovery Segments (20-30 minutes): Propose a series of yoga poses (Work) interspersed with short relaxation or breathing exercises (Recovery). Tailor the intensity based on the user's average heart rate and physical activity levels.
Cooldown (5 minutes): Include calming poses or stretches, focusing on mindfulness to align with the user's mindful session habits.
ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES:

Ensure the exercises are safe and appropriate for the user's body mass and height.
Balance the session intensity with periods of relaxation to avoid overexertion.
Incorporate mindfulness elements in line with the user's mindful session data.
